Abstraction

Hiding internal implementation details and just highlight the set of services what we are offering is called Abstraction.

ex- Bank ATM machine, bank will highlight the set of services what they offering without highlighting the internal 
implementation is Abstraction.

Two ways to achieve Abstraction
> interface
> abstract class

Advantages of abstraction are-
1. As the internal implementation is hidden from the outside world hence security can be achieved.
2. Also internal implementation can be enhanced easily without affecting outside world.
