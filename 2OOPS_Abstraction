Abstraction

Hiding internal implementation details and just highlight the set of services what we are offering is called Abstraction.

ex- Bank ATM machine, bank will highlight the set of services what they offering without highlighting the internal 
implementation is Abstraction.

Two ways to achieve Abstraction
> interface
> abstract class

Advantages of abstraction are-
1. As the internal implementation is hidden from the outside world hence security can be achieved.
2. Also internal implementation can be enhanced easily without affecting outside world.
3. It Improves Maintainability and Modularity of the Application.


What AI says about it---------------------

key - Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods, controlling access. Abstraction is about hiding complexity.


Abstraction in Java (Layman's Explanation):

Imagine you‚Äôre using a TV remote. You press buttons like Power, Volume Up, or Channel Change to control the TV. You don‚Äôt need to know how the remote‚Äôs circuits or infrared signals work internally. You just need to know what the buttons do, not how they do it.

Abstraction in Java works the same way:

It hides complex internal details and shows only the essential features (like the remote‚Äôs buttons).
You focus on what an object does, not how it does it.
Real-Life Example: A Car
When you drive a car:

You use the steering wheel, brake pedal, and accelerator (these are like the ‚Äúmethods‚Äù you interact with).
You don‚Äôt need to know how the engine, transmission, or sensors work internally.
In Java, abstraction lets you design a Car class with methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate(), without worrying about the internal mechanics.

How Java Implements Abstraction
Java uses abstract classes and interfaces to create abstraction:

Abstract Classes:

Define a "blueprint" with some unfinished methods (like rules for what a subclass must do).
Example-
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (no body - details hidden)
    abstract void makeSound();

    // Regular method
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Zzz...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // The subclass fills in the hidden details
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}

Here, Animal hides how each animal makes a sound. The Dog class provides the specifics.



Interfaces:

Define a contract of methods that classes must implement.
Example:
interface Phone {
    void call(); // What it does (details hidden)
}

class Smartphone implements Phone {
    public void call() {
        System.out.println("Calling via 4G..."); // How it does it
    }
}

Why Abstraction Matters
Simplifies Complexity:
You don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by internal details (e.g., using Arrays.sort() without knowing the sorting algorithm).
Reusability:
A single Payment interface can handle credit cards, PayPal, etc., without rewriting code.
Focus on Essentials:
A banking app shows you a "Transfer Money" button but hides the backend security checks.
Key Takeaway
Abstraction is like using a menu at a restaurant:

You order a dish (call a method like orderPizza()).
You don‚Äôt need to know the recipe, cooking steps, or kitchen setup (hidden details).
In Java, abstraction helps you build systems where you interact with ideas (like "save data" or "play music") instead of getting lost in the weeds of how they happen. üéÆüîß
